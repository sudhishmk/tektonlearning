Act as a Tekton Pipeline expert. Your task is to generate the complete YAML manifest for a Tekton CI/CD pipeline.

The pipeline must perform the following sequence of operations:
1. Clone a Git repository.
2. Build a container image using the Dockerfile in the repository.
3. Push the container image to a specified image registry.
4. Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster by applying a manifest.

### Requirements & Constraints

- **Source Code:**
  - Git Repository URL: `[e.g., https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git]`
  - Git Revision: `[e.g., main or a specific branch/commit]`

- **Build Process:**
  - Use the `buildah` Task from artifact Hub to build the image.
  - The path to the Dockerfile is `[e.g., ./Dockerfile]`.
  - The built image should be tagged with the git commit SHA.

- **Image Registry:**
  - Push the image to: `[e.g., gcr.io/my-project/my-app]`
  - The pipeline will need credentials for this registry. Assume a Secret named `[e.g., docker-credentials]` is available.

- **Deployment:**
  - Use the `kubernetes-actions` Task from Tekton artifact Hub.
  - The action is `kubectl apply -f [path/to/kubernetes/manifest.yaml]`.
  - The pipeline needs access to the cluster. Assume a Secret named `[e.g., kube-credentials]` is available for authentication.

### Output Format

- Generate a single YAML file containing all necessary resources.
- The output should include the definitions for:
  1. A `Pipeline` resource named `[e.g., my-app-ci-cd-pipeline]`.
  2. Any necessary `PipelineResources` or `Workspaces`.
  3. A sample `PipelineRun` to trigger the pipeline with example parameters (e.g., git-url, image-repo).
- Add comments in the YAML to explain each Task and parameter.
